    "## The Plan: \n",
    "Our model is based on an article that analyzes the continuous behavior of mice in a free-roam environment. Precisely, mice are placed into an operant box where if a lever is pressed for a certain threshold of duration (800ms) then the mouse is rewarded with sucrose or food pellets. Behavioral data is collected regarding the number of lever presses and the duration of each lever press. Neural data is also recorded in terms of intracellular calcium ion concetration via GCaMP protein photometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because both behaviral and neural data are time-series data that share many similarities with sequntial data that is commonly processed with transformer models, we propose to construct a encoder-decoder transformer model to: \n",
    "1. predict the subsequence sequence of neural activity given previous neural recordings. \n",
    "2. Translate abstract neural data prediction in to concrete behavioral predictions. "

    "## The Data\n",
    "Our input data takes the form of both neural and behavioral time sereis data. Specifically, we use lever press duration as the behavioral component input while we use the corresponding GCaMP protein recording per second for the neural component input."
